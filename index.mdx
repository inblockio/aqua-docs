**Aqua Protocol** is an open, private, and decentralized solution for data accountability and governance. Built with modern cryptographic standards, Aqua enables you to verify data integrity and provenance without relying on centralized authorities.

<Note>
**Powered by Cryptography, Not Blockchain**

Aqua Protocol is made possible by crypto—as in _cryptography_! While it can use Ethereum for timestamping, the protocol itself neither is nor requires blockchain technology. It's a privacy-preserving, open-source protocol built on modern cryptographic methods.

## What is Aqua Protocol?

The Aqua Protocol is a foundational framework for building distributed trust networks. By leveraging hash-chains, cryptographic signatures, and optional blockchain timestamping, Aqua enables scalable, trustless verification of data integrity and provenance. It empowers developers and innovators to create applications that certify, attest, and secure data in an open and decentralized way.

</Card>

Trust can be built by relying on hashing and encryption mechanisms or by delegating to a mutually trusted party. Aqua Protocol handles both scenarios, giving you flexibility in how you establish and verify trust.



## How It Works

At its core, Aqua creates portable hash-chains—called **AquaTrees**—that record a gapless history of data revisions. These trees can be timestamped on Ethereum for immutability, exchanged across services, and verified automatically. Whether securing documents, systems, or identities, Aqua liberates the certification process from institutional gatekeepers, making trust accessible through open cryptographic standards.

### Key Features

- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Cryptographic hashes ensure any modification is immediately detectable
- **Multi-Party Signatures**: Collect signatures from multiple parties for authentication and non-repudiation
- **Blockchain Timestamping**: Optional anchoring to Ethereum, Nostr, or TSA for provable timestamps
- **Portable Verification**: AquaTrees can be exchanged, stored, and verified anywhere
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Only hashes are stored on-chain, keeping your data private
