The Aqua Protocol is a foundational framework for building distributed trust networks. By leveraging hash-chains, cryptographic signatures, and Ethereum-based timestamping, Aqua enables scalable, trustless verification of data integrity and provenance without reliance on centralized authorities. It empowers developers and innovators to create applications that certify, attest, and secure data in an open, private and decentralized way.

  The protocol is all about building trust.

Trust can be build by relying on hashing/encryption mechanism or by delegating to  a mutually trusted party, Aqua protocol can handles both scenarios for you.



## How It Works

At its core, Aqua creates portable hash-chains—called AquaTrees—that record a gapless history of data revisions. These trees can be timestamped on Ethereum for immutability, exchanged across services, and verified automatically. Whether securing documents, systems, or identities, Aqua liberates the certification process from institutional gatekeepers, making trust accessible through open cryptographic standards.

We’re excited to see where this journey takes us—and invite you to explore, build, and contribute to the future of decentralized trust with Aqua Protocol Version 4.
