Data Governance identifies how to manage the value of data. A well-known
turning point in history was the publication of [Luca
Pacioli](wikipedia:Luca_Pacioli "wikilink")'s [Summa de
arithmetica](wikipedia:Summa_de_arithmetica "wikilink"). This
encyclopedia of mathematics, had 26 pages worth of text on what we call
[Double-entry
bookkeeping](wikipedia:Double-entry_bookkeeping "wikilink"). This became
the foundational literature for
[accounting](wikipedia:accounting "wikilink"), the progenitor of using
data to assign value to accounts, and henceforth gave birth to the
practice of data governance.

# Accounting as the foundation of Data Governance

According to historian Jane-Gleeson White[^1][^2], Pacioli's double
entry book keeping idea influenced the development of arts, sciences,
and capitalism. [Double-entry
bookkeeping](wikipedia:Double-entry_bookkeeping "wikilink") as a
rigorous approach to ensure data integrity, not only influenced the
practice of the accounting profession, and it had a significant impact
on the the formulation of [Hamiltonian
Mechanics](wikipedia:Hamiltonian_Mechanics "wikilink"), which is a
foundational theory of both classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.

Sir [William Rowan
Hamilton](wikipedia:William_Rowan_Hamilton "wikilink") wrote a paper[^3]
cited many many scholars to demonstrate that many ideas about complex
algebraic manipulation that laid the foundation of scientific
revolutions are based on the formulation of creating accountable
mathematical formulation strategies through double entry book keeping.
[David Ellerman](https://www.ellerman.org) had a paper that explains the
powers of double entry bookkeeping in sciences[^4]. The notion that
creating public addresses for transactions amongst different accounts
has been documented as a scientific theory on Double Entry Book-keeping.

## Digital Governance

Given the intellectual roots of data governance have strong linkages to
mathematics and accounting, it is only after the introduction of
[personal computing devices](wikipedia:personal_computer "wikilink"),
and later the ubiquity of [Internet](wikipedia:Internet "wikilink")
access that made data governance an idea relevant to public affairs. The
argument is that many people's basic privacy and property rights may be
challenged by people who have access to data collection and deployment
technologies. Imminent threats such as fake news, big brother monitoring
practices, identity thefts, and crypto currency issuance are already
challenging the stability of the existing social fabric. These type of
social debates are often related to the ideas of [Digital
governance](wikipedia:Digital_governance "wikilink"). At this time,
digital governance has not yet become a mature field of study, and it
needs to be grounded in simple principles, so that it can be
transparently practiced with local adaptations.

## Conceptualization of Data Governance

Beside the notion of digital governance, data as an asset class must be
kept accountable, so that it can be evaluated, and transferred with an
objective operational framework. Knowing how to organize data in formats
that satisfy consistent abstraction strategies, such as [Universal
Resource Identifier](wikipedia:URI "wikilink") and [Universal Resource
Locator](wikipedia:URL "wikilink") are important starting points in this
field. Earlier work in data governance in a web of [hyperlinked
media](wikipedia:Hyperlink "wikilink") can be traced back to [Project
Xanadu](wikipedia:Project_Xanadu "wikilink") by [Ted
Nelson](wikipedia:Ted_Nelson "wikilink").

More recent more publications in this fields are
[Lessig](wikipedia:Lawrence_Lessig "wikilink")'s [Code
v2](https://lessig.org/product/codev2)[^6] and soon to be published work
of [Alex Pentland](wikipedia:Alex_Pentland "wikilink")'s [Building the
New Economy](https://wip.mitpress.mit.edu/new-economy)[^7].
