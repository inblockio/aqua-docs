## Introduction

The Aqua Protocol (AQP) is a data accountability and exchange protocol between hosts in peer-to-peer environments. The AQP is used to realize the goal of accounting for data origin and history (data provenance). Short: A verifiable linkable data structure to attest and certify data.

Issues for improving the protocol are tracked here: https://github.com/inblockio/aqua-improvement-proposal


## Motivation

In today's world, there are no widely adopted trustless processes of checking if
data have been manipulated or corrupted, are attributed to the wrong author, or
are attributed to the wrong time. Today's processes are dependent on centralized
trusted services which retain all power over governing the data.

There is a lack of transparency or ability to check if data have been altered
by an unauthorized party. Additionally, consumers of data are incapable of
verifying if centralized services have altered the data. This leads to a world
of untrustworthy information in which we don't know how to conclude what is
true.

In a world where every piece of information is a grain in a sandstorm, it has
become impossible to navigate reality. In contrast, in a world where every
piece of information is a fixed star in the sky for a lifetime, we are able to
relate and make sense of the information given. The Aqua Protocol (AQP) turns
grains of information into fixed stars of information.

The AQP adds a peer-to-peer layer of accountability, making it impossible to
change data unnoticed. AQP adds an essential line of defense against attacks on
data integrity, plagiarism, or misattribution. AQP is used to govern trusted
data, which can be quickly verified. This includes the verification of its
integrity and history, the verification of its account (the entity who creates
or manipulates the data), and the verification of its existence and timestamp.
