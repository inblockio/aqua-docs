Aqua protocol is a fundamental building block for distributed trust networks. 
It can be used to build many different applications.
Examples for this are notarization which enable:
- data accountability (data accounting)
- access control 
- identity claims and attestations, and more

What has been built (prototypes):
 - building federated wiki infrastructure with notarization build in (PKC https://pkc.inblock.io Protocol version v1.2)
 - building a chrome extension for name-resolution and aqua-tree verification (Chrome Extension: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/aqua-verifier/gadnjidhhadchnegnpadkibmjlgihiaj Protocol version v1.2)
 - building firewall like systems with automated access control enforcement and integration to ("Guardian" Protocol version v1.2)
 - building a document/file signing service ("Aquafier" https://aquafier.com Protocol version v1.2 upgrading to 3)
 - building a decentralised identity solution (Aqua Forms Protocol version 3)

We are still finding out what this animal is, we have created. So here are some other takes on it:
- Aqua Protocols enables open, private and decentralised solutions for general data notarization!
- A verifiable linkable data structure to attest and certify data.
- A protocol for data accountability and provenance.
- A protocol for distributed trust networks.
