Aqua Name Resolution (ANS) is used to resolve hashes of various types to human readable names.

The following hashes are resolved by the ANS:
* wallet-addresses to names, organisations an aliases.
* genesis_hashes to titles.
* domain_ids to registered endpoints of that domain.

See the [reference implementation](https://github.com/inblockio/aqua-verifier-webextension/blob/main/src/name_resolver.ts).
